1. get OAuth working. the result will be a redirect to /form?access_token={real_access_token}
2. get the form submission working
  a. the result is that the form submits to reddit and posts the message to the subreddit
  b. alternatively (for test) hard code some other subreddit or your own personal test "subreddit"
     so that you're not posting test junk to the real subreddit

apirouter:
      getHeadlineAndArchiveUrl(req.query.url as string).then(([headline, archiveUrl]) => postAsUser(headline || "Headline not detected", req.query.spoiler as string, archiveUrl, auth.username, auth.password, req.query.token as string));
      - fix req.query.url => get url
      - query currently only holds token
